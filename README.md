# Objective 
1. Utilize team git, create a develop branch and sub-branches for project collaborators. 
2. Grab the user's location upon running the application. 
3. Using the location, use GET requests to fetch information from two APIs. 
* NASA: https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/earth/imagery
* Open Weather: https://openweathermap.org/current
   * Based on your location, from the NASA Earth api grab a satellite image matching your location and the weather in your current location.
   * Additionally, add a button that toggles between Fahrenheit and Centigrade when pulling from the weather api.
   * Use Material UI, Reactstrap, or styled components to style out the project however your team decides. 
<br />

# Requirements
* The application must pull data from the NASA and Open Weather API's and present it to the DOM
